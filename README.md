This repository contains the code for an Intelligent Desktop Assistant project called "Jarvis." The assistant utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing, and various APIs to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Voice recognition:** Jarvis can understand and convert speech to text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **Website opening:** Open popular websites like YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google with simple voice commands.
- **Music playback:** Enjoy music by playing local files using Jarvis.
- **Time display:** Ask Jarvis for the current time, and it will provide the information.
- **App launching:** Open specific applications such as FaceTime with voice commands.
- **Artificial Intelligence integration:** The project leverages OpenAI to enhance natural language processing capabilities.
- **Chatting with Jarvis:** Engage in conversations with Jarvis and get intelligent responses.
- **Chat history reset:** Reset the chat history with Jarvis to start fresh.
